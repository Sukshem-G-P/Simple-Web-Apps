<b>Overview</b><br>
This To-Do List application is a simple yet functional web app that allows users to manage their tasks interactively. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging local storage to persist user data across sessions.
<br><br>
<b>Features</b><br>

<b>Task Addition:</b>
Users can enter text into an input field and add it to the list by clicking the "Add" button.
If the input field is empty, an alert prompts the user to enter some text.<br>

<b>Task Management:</b>
Tasks are displayed in an unordered list.
Each task can be checked off by clicking on it, which applies a "checked" style to indicate completion (strikethrough text and changed background image).
Tasks can be removed by clicking the "Ã—" button next to them.<br>

<b>Persistent Storage:</b>
The state of the To-Do List (tasks added, checked, or removed) is saved in the browser's local storage.
On page reload, previously saved tasks are loaded from local storage, ensuring the list persists between sessions.<br>

<b>Responsive Design:</b>
The application uses a gradient background and a centered container that adjusts to different screen sizes.
Input and button elements are styled for usability and aesthetics, ensuring a pleasant user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.<br>

<b>Visual Design:</b>
The to-do list container has a clean, white background with rounded corners, providing a modern look.
The input field and button are styled with a rounded appearance and contrasting colors for clarity and ease of use.
Tasks are visually distinguished by background images and styles for both checked and unchecked states.<br>

<b>Interactive Elements:</b>
Clicking on a task toggles its "checked" state.
Hover effects on the remove button enhance user interactivity.
